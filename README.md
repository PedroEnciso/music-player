This app is a music player containing Lo-Fi hip hop songs taken from Chillhop's free library. I created this app while following a video, so I can become more familiar with using React.

This is my second project using React, this one being the most complete, and I like how close everything feels to each other. By everything I mean the HTML, CSS and Javscript code. In earlier projects, I would complete all the HTML and CSS together, and then usually come back later and add functionality ina .js file. But with React, everything happens at the same time. Including the pages HTML in the same file as the Javascript code makes everything convenient and easy to implement.

One thing I don't really understand yet is how to make an app with two pages using React. This is something I hope to tackle in my next project, along with become more comfortable with states which are the most complicated aspect of React that I've encountered so far.
